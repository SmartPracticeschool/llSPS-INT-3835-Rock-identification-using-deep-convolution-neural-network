Rock identification using deep convolution neural networks:


Rock are a fundamental component of earth. The automatic identification of rock type in the field would aid geological surveying, education and automatic mapping. 
Visual inspection assesses properties such as color, shape, etc. It is a basic part of geological surveying, research and education. 
The traditional method of rock classification is a time-consuming process and has less accuracy rate.
So, this project basically aims on making a system using deep CNN which can detect the rock type and help people in knowing the types instantly.
